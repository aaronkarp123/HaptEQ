# HaptEQ
HaptEQ is a research project conducted by Aaron Karp in Northwestern's Interactive Audio Lab under the mentorship of Dr. Bryan Pardo. A paper detailing the system was accepted and presented at the 2017 Audio Mostly Conference in London.

HaptEQ was created to aid visually impaired musicians and producers to intuitively create EQ input in a method that has previously been unavailable to them.
